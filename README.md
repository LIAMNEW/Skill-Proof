# SkillProof

A recruiting tool that analyses GitHub profiles to extract real technical skills and match candidates to job descriptions using AI.

## What It Does

SkillProof solves the tech recruiting problem of hiring based on resumes rather than actual coding ability. Instead of relying on self-reported skills, it analyses real code contributions to provide:

- **Language Distribution** - Breakdown of programming languages used across repositories
- **Technical Skills** - AI-extracted skills with proficiency levels (Expert/Intermediate/Beginner)
- **Experience Summary** - AI-generated analysis of coding experience and notable projects
- **Job Matching** - Match score calculation between a candidate's skills and job requirements
- **Hiring Recommendations** - Clear hire/interview/pass recommendations with reasoning

## How To Use

1. Enter a GitHub username to analyse
2. View the candidate's technical profile and AI-generated insights
3. Paste a job description to calculate a match score
4. Get a hiring recommendation based on skill alignment

## Tech Stack
